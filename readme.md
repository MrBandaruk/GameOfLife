## Conway's game of life

My implementation of popular game. You can find information about it [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Use Left Mouse Click to draw and Right Mouse Click to delete cells.

### Rules

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
